# AI Agent Guidelines for SOME/IP Gateway

<!-- The first sections are based on https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills -->

## General instructions

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Temporary files

- Use `.llm_tmp/` (repo root) for any temporary files — PR/issue bodies, scratch scripts, intermediate outputs.
- **Never use `/tmp` or other paths outside the workspace.**
- `.llm_tmp/` is an **ephemeral scratch directory** — deleting or overwriting files inside it is always safe and **does not require user confirmation**. Wipe it before writing new files to avoid name clashes.

## Project Overview

The S-CORE SOME/IP Gateway bridges the SCORE middleware with SOME/IP communication stacks. It's divided into two architectural components with an IPC isolation boundary:
- **gatewayd**: Network-independent gateway logic (C++)
- **someipd**: SOME/IP stack binding (C++)

The gateway also includes Rust examples and comprehensive Python integration tests.

## Code Style & Conventions

**All source files must include Apache 2.0 license headers:**
```cpp

```

**C++ style**: namespace organization (e.g., `score::someip_gateway::gatewayd`), includes config via FlatBuffers, uses RAII patterns for resource management.

**Rust style**: Standard Rust formatting with module organization matching C++ namespaces conceptually.

## Architecture & Key Patterns

**Core Components:**
- [src/gatewayd/](src/gatewayd/) - Main daemon, configuration via FlatBuffers ([gatewayd_config.fbs](src/gatewayd/etc/gatewayd_config.fbs))
- [src/socom/](src/socom/) - SOME/IP abstraction with plugin interface for IPC binding
- [src/someipd/](src/someipd/) - SOME/IP binding layer
- [src/network_service/interfaces/](src/network_service/interfaces/) - Network abstraction (message_transfer.h)
- [examples/car_window_sim/](examples/car_window_sim/) - Complete working Rust example

**Design Patterns:**
- Configuration injection via FlatBuffers binary (see [main.cpp](src/gatewayd/main.cpp#L52) for loading pattern)
- IPC boundaries enforce ASIL/QM context separation
- JSON schemas validate configuration ([gatewayd_config.schema.json](src/gatewayd/etc/gatewayd_config.schema.json))

## Build & Test Commands

**Bazel is the primary build system.** Python 3.12 is required; pinned in MODULE.bazel.

```bash
# Build specific target
bazel build //src/gatewayd:gatewayd

# Run daemons (requires two terminals)
bazel run //src/gatewayd:gatewayd_example
bazel run //src/someipd

# Run example application
bazel run //examples/car_window_sim:car_window_controller

# Run all tests
bazel test //...

# Run unit tests
bazel test //src/...

# Run integration tests
bazel test //tests/integration:integration

# Run performance benchmarks
bazel test //tests/benchmarks:all

# Generate/update compile_commands.json for IDE support
bazel run //:bazel-compile-commands
```

**When adding new code, tests are required by default:**
- Integration tests in [tests/integration/BUILD.bazel](tests/integration/BUILD.bazel)
- Unit tests next to the software elements source code
- Use `py_pytest` rule for Python tests

## Project Conventions

**Directory layout**
- Units and components are called software elements
- Software elements are placed underneath [src/](src/)
- A software elements directory be default looks like this:
  ```
  <software element>/
  ├── BUILD
  ├── doc/
  ├── include/
  ├── src/
  └── test/```

**Configuration Management:**
- FlatBuffers schemas define typed configs (see [gatewayd_config.fbs](src/gatewayd/etc/gatewayd_config.fbs))
- JSON schemas auto-generated for validation (tool: flatbuffers/flatc)
- Config files loaded from binary format (see [main.cpp](src/gatewayd/main.cpp#L52))

**Logging & Shutdown:**
- Use `std::cout`/`std::cerr` for basic logging (see [main.cpp](src/gatewayd/main.cpp#L37))
- Implement graceful shutdown with signal handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT)

**Example Pattern (Rust state machines):**
Reference [car_window.rs](examples/car_window_sim/src/car_window.rs#L27) for window state machine implementation—shows how to structure stateful domain logic.

## Integration Points

**External Dependencies:**
- `@score_communication` - SCORE middleware (IPC via mw/com)
- `@flatbuffers` - Configuration serialization
- `@someip_pip` - SOME/IP stack bindings in Python tests
- `@bazel_tools_python` - Testing framework (py_pytest)

**Configuration:**
- Service instances read from [mw_com_config.json](src/gatewayd/etc/mw_com_config.json)
- SOME/IP specifics in [vsomeip.json](tests/integration/vsomeip.json) and [vsomeip-local.json](tests/integration/vsomeip-local.json)

## Security & ASIL Considerations

The IPC boundary between gatewayd and someipd enforces **ASIL/QM context separation**—this is a critical architectural boundary. Changes affecting message transfer across this boundary require careful review.
